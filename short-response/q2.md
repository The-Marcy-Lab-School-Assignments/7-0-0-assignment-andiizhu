# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer

The return value of the `useState` hook is an array that is a duple. The first element is the current state, this value matches the initial value that the `useState` hook is set to. The second element uses the `set` function that allows the first element or current state to be updated and trigger a re-render.
