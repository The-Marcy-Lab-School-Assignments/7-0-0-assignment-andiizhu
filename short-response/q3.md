# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer

The setter function schedules an update to the current state value. React then triggers a re-render of the component using the updated state value. Finally, React's reconciliation process updates the actual DOM to reflect the new state. Therefore, if you console.log the state value immediately after calling the setter function, it will reflect the old state value because the re-render has not occurred yet. Essentially, the current state value only gets updated after the re-rendering.
